\section{Introduction}
This chapter provides an overview of related work to contextualize the primary objectives of this thesis. Firstly, in Section~\ref{section:ift}, Information Flow Tracking (IFT) is introduced, detailing the different types and their respective purposes. We discuss the various levels of monitoring, from program behaviour to the detection of hardware trojans.
Then in Section~\ref{section:physicalAttacks}, Physical Attacks are examined, focusing on two main types: Side-Channel Attacks (SCA) and Fault Injection Attacks (FIA).
Finally in Section~\ref{section:countermeasuresAgainstFIA}, as this work concentrate on FIA, we exclusively present countermeasures against Fault Injection Attacks.

\section{Information Flow Tracking}
\label{section:ift}
The concept of \textit{Information Flow Tracking} has been introduced by the work of Bell and LaPadula~\cite{BLP-76-military} and by Denning~\cite{D-76-commacm} in 1976.
This section introduces Information Flow Tracking mechanisms, explains how they work, and presents the various types of IFT with their different functional levels.
    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Different types of IFT}
There are two distinct types of IFT approaches: static and dynamic, each with its own specific objectives.

\subsubsection{Static IFT}
Static Information Flow Tracking (SIFT) is a security technique used to analyse and control the flow of information within a program or system without executing it, by examining the source code or compiled binary~\cite{HAK-21-acmcsur}. This method is particularly useful for identifying theoretical vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance with design principles, and preventing unauthorised information leaks before deployment. SIFT is comprehensive, covering all possible execution paths and detecting both explicit information flows (direct data assignments) and implicit flows (leaks through control flow structures). By performing checks at compile-time, SIFT helps developers address potential security issues early, enforcing principles like non-interference and data confidentiality through security policies. However, static analysis may generate false positives by flagging theoretical flows that might not occur in practice and may struggle with certain dynamic language features or runtime-dependent behaviours. SIFT is employed in various contexts, such as verifying secure information flow in operating systems, programming languages with built-in information flow controls, and hardware design for secure systems.

\subsubsection{Dynamic IFT}
Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) is a powerful security technique that monitors and analyses, in real-time, the flow of information within a program during its execution~\cite{CGDJ-21-micromac}. DIFT operates by tagging or labelling input data from potentially untrusted sources and tracking how this data propagates through the system~\cite{SLD-04-sigplan}. As the program executes, DIFT maintains metadata about the tagged information, updating it as operations are performed on the data. This allows the system to detect when tainted data is used in security-critical operations, such as modifying control flow or accessing sensitive resources. DIFT can be implemented at various levels, including hardware, software, or a combination of both. Hardware-based implementations often offer better performance but require specialized processor modifications, while software-based approaches provide more flexibility but may incur higher overhead~\cite{CGDJ-21-micromac}. DIFT has proven effective in detecting and preventing a wide range of security vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, format string attacks, and code injection attacks~\cite{SLD-04-sigplan}. However, DIFT also faces challenges, such as handling implicit information flows, managing performance overhead, and addressing over-tainting issues.
This approach might not cover all potential data paths, as it is dependent on the specific conditions and inputs provided during the monitoring period.
Despite these challenges, DIFT remains a valuable tool for software security, particularly for runtime attack detection in modern systems.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%    
\subsection{Different levels of DIFT}
IFT can be implemented at various levels of abstraction in computing systems~\cite{HAK-21-acmcsur, BSMCVEJCO-21-acmcsur,CGDJ-21-micromac}. Each level presents unique trade-offs between precision, performance overhead, and ease of implementation, allowing designers to choose the most appropriate approach for their security requirements.

Software-based DIFT mechanisms benefit from close integration with the software context via binary code instrumentation and source code modifications, offering better flexibility, customisation, and scalability without altering hardware components. However, these software solutions often incur high performance overheads due to the extra instructions required. They operate at either the system level, monitoring OS-wide information flows, or the program level, focusing on specific applications.
On the other hand, hardware-assisted DIFT designs can efficiently enforce security rules by implementing DIFT-related operations as hardware logic, reducing performance overhead but at the expense of flexibility and scalability, making them challenging to deploy in modern commercial systems. They can be implemented within processor cores or as off-core designs. But they can also be at the lowest level, such as Gate-Level IFT who tracks information flow through logic gates.
A hybrid hardware and software co-design offers a promising alternative, enabling fine-grained security checks by associating software context with hardware data, though it faces challenges such as balancing flexibility with hardware overhead and designing appropriate tags that support rule updates post-deployment.

Figure~\ref{fig:levels_system} represents the different levels of a simplified embedded system: application layer, system service layer, OS layer, and hardware layer. This figure is inspired by Figure 1.9 of~\cite{ebrary}. Software-based IFTs work in the first three levels.

Positioned at the highest level of the software hierarchy, \textit{the application layer} is responsible for implementing system functionalities and business logic. Functionally, all modules within this layer work together to execute the required system operations. Applications generally run in a less-privileged mode on the processor and utilise the OS-provided API scheduling to communicate with the operating system.
\textit{The system service layer} serves as the intermediary service interface offered by the OS to the application layer. This interface allows applications to access a variety of OS-provided services, essentially bridging the gap between the OS and applications. Typically, this layer encompasses components like the file system, Graphical User Interface (GUI), task manager.
An Operating System (OS) is a software framework designed to manage hardware resources uniformly. It abstracts numerous hardware functions and offers them to applications as services. Common services provided by an OS include scheduling, file synchronisation, and networking. Operating systems are prevalent in both desktop and embedded systems. In the context of embedded systems, OSs possess distinct characteristics such as stability, customisability, modularity, and real-time processing capabilities.
\textit{The hardware layer} refers to the physical components and circuitry, including the microprocessor or microcontroller, memory, sensors, and input/output interfaces. This layer encompasses all the tangible electronic elements that interact directly with each other to perform the device's functions. It provides the essential infrastructure that supports and drives the embedded systemâ€™s operations and connectivity.

Tracking information can be performed at various levels, from the application level to the hardware level. Each level offers distinct advantages and disadvantages.
For instance, application-level tracking might provide detailed insights and user-friendly interfaces, while hardware-level tracking offers more granular data and real-time monitoring but can be more complex and costly.
The following subsections explore these different levels, highlighting their respective benefits and limitations.


\subsubsection{Software-based DIFT}
\paragraph{Application level DIFT} tracks information flows between application variables. The programmer has to integrate data tagging inside his program and use a modified compiler or analyse his program to check if no security violation happened.
One application for DIFT at application level is language-based. Several security extensions have been proposed for existing programming languages.
JFlow~\cite{M-99-popl} is one of the first works that has described an extension of the Java language by adding statically-checked information flow annotations.

Multiples works introduce DIFT extensions for different languages, for example, such as JavaScript~\cite{CN-15-ccs, AF-09-plas}.
Austin et al.~\cite{AF-09-plas} propose a method for tracking information flow in dynamically-typed languages, focusing on addressing issues with implicit paths through a dynamic check. This approach avoids the necessity for approximate static analyses while still ensuring non-interference. The method employs sparse information labelling, keeping flow labels implicit where possible and introducing explicit labels only for values crossing security domains.

Kemerlis et al.~\cite{KPJK-12-sigplan} provide a framework, \textit{libdft}, which is fast and reusable and applicable to software and hardware. \textit{libdft} provides an API for building DFT-enabled tools that work on unmodified binaries.

\paragraph{OS level and System-based DIFT} track and tag files (read or written) used by the application.
The main advantage of this approach is that it reduces the number of information flows, which lead to an improvement of the runtime overhead. In the other side, the main disadvantage of this approach is that it results in more false positives than the application-level approach.

TaintDroid~\cite{EGHTCCJMS-14-tocs} introduces an extension to the Android mobile phone platform designed to monitor the flow of privacy-sensitive data through third-party applications. Operating under the assumption that downloaded third-party applications are untrusted, TaintDroid tracks in real-time how these applications access and handle usersâ€™ personal information. The primary objectives are to detect when sensitive data is transmitted out of the system by untrusted applications, and to enable phone users or external security services to analyse these applications. They store the data adjacent to data for spatial locality. This may cause large performance and storage overheads, as the tag fetching requires extra clock cycles for memory access.
HiStar~\cite{ZBKM-11-commacm} is a new OS that has been designed to provide precise data specific security policies. The authors made the choice to assign tags to different objects in the operating system instead of data.


\subsubsection{Software and Hardware Co-Design-Based DIFT}
This type of design combines the features of both software DIFT and hardware DIFT. Using binary instrumentations and a modified compiler, the hardware and software co-design can provide the best of these two categories of DIFT: flexible security configuration and fine-grained protection with low impact on performances~\cite{CGDJ-21-micromac, BSMCVEJCO-21-acmcsur}.

One example of this type of DIFT is RIFLE~\cite{VBCROBRVA-04-micro}, a runtime information-flow security system designed from the user's perspective, provides a practical means to enforce information-flow security policies on all programs by leveraging architectural support.
RIFLE employs binary instrumentation and architectural support to enforce information flow security policies during runtime. The conventional Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is transformed into an Information-Flow Security (IFS) ISA using a dedicated binary translator. Each instruction in the ISA corresponds to an instruction in the IFS ISA. 
In the IFS ISA, additional security registers are assigned to hold tags. To avoid the pitfalls dynamic mechanisms encountered while tracking implicit flows, the binary translation will convert all implicit flows to explicit flows. The RIFLE architecture is then responsible only for tracking explicit flows. The translated binary is executed within a modified processor supporting the IFS ISA, which is simulated within the Liberty Simulation Environment. RIFLE works with every programs that run on a system, and policy decisions are left to the user, not the programmer.

Townley et al.~\cite{TKPAY-19-micro} presented LATCH, a generalizable architecture for optimizing DIFT. 
LATCH exploits the observation that information flows under DIFT exhibit strong spatial and temporal locality, with typical applications manipulating sensitive data during limited phases of computation. The main objective is to detect attacks on the integrity of the system. The architecture consists of a software-assisted hardware accelerator (S-LATCH) running on a single simulated core. The software component of S-LATCH propagates tags, while the hardware accelerator monitors the data accessed by the program to detect tags. 

Porquet et al.~\cite{PS-13-codes} presented WHISK, a whole system DIFT architecture implemented within a hardware simulator. WHISK stores tags and data separately in memory locations to keep low area overhead and improve flexibility and to better accommodate the integration of hardware accelerators.. Tag insertion, storage, and access to the custom hardware are delegated. The software subsystem uses MutekH exokernel-based OS and provides support for tag page allocation, page table cache configuration, and interrupt handling concerning writes to untagged pages.


\subsubsection{Hardware-based DIFT}
Dalton et al.~\cite{DKK-07-sigarch} report that software DIFT solutions add significative runtime overhead, up to a slow-down of 37 times ! Therefore, in order to improve the execution time to be more on-the-fly, the idea is to directly implement the DIFT into the hardware, but the trade-off is flexibility.
This subsection discusses the hardware-based DIFT designs, including gate-level DIFT designs and micro-architecture-level DIFT designs. Surveys~\cite{HAK-21-acmcsur,BSMCVEJCO-21-acmcsur} present an overview on all hardware DIFT techniques. They developed a taxonomy for them and use it to classify and differentiate hardware DIFT tools and techniques.

\paragraph{Gate-Level DIFT} include gate-level netlist and also RTL designs. The goal is to protect against hardware trojans and unauthorized behaviours. To achieve that, during the creation of the circuit, additional logic is added for each gate used in the design.

GLIFT~\cite{TWMMCS-09-asplos} is a well-established IFT technique. The goal is to protect against hardware trojans and unauthorized behaviours. All information flows, both explicit and implicit, are unified at the gate level. GLIFT employs a detailed initialisation and propagation policy to precisely track each bit of information flow, by adding additional logic for each gate used in the design. By analysing how inputs influence outputs, GLIFT accurately measures true information flows and substantially reduces the false positives typically associated with conservative IFT techniques.
Hu et al.~\cite{HOITSMK-11-tcad} established the theoretical foundation for GLIFT. They introduced several algorithms for generating GLIFT logic in large digital circuits. Additionally, the authors identified the primary source of precision discrepancies in GLIFT logic produced by various methods as static logic hazards or variable correlation due to reconvergent fan-outs. Many other works have been done on GLIFT to attempt a decrease of the logic complexity.

\paragraph{Off-Core DIFT} operations are performed on a dedicated coprocessor working in parallel of the main core.
The main drawback is that this approach needs a support from the OS for the synchronisation between data computations and tags computations in order to stall one core if it needs to wait the other. But on the other hand, its advantage is that it does not require internal hardware modifications to the main kernel. Processor manufacturers do not prioritise this type of security, and as most processors are not open to the public, it is difficult to modify them.

Kannan et al.~\cite{KDK-09-dsn} described one of the first work using a coprocessor to improve tag computation runtime overhead. Traditional hardware DIFT systems require significant modifications to the processor pipeline, which increases complexity and design time. Figure~\ref{fig:offcore_dift} represent how an off-core DIFT would be implemented. Kannan et al. uses this idea for implementing their solution of DIFT.
This coprocessor handles all DIFT functionalities, synchronizing with the main processor only during system calls. This design eliminates the need for changes to the processor's pipeline, logic, or caches, making it more attractive. The coprocessor is small, with an area footprint of about 8\% of a simple RISC core, and introduces less than 1\% runtime overhead for SPECint2000 applications benchmark. The paper demonstrates that the coprocessor provides the same security guarantees as integrated DIFT architectures, supporting multiple security policies and protecting various memory regions and binary types. This approach offers a balanced solution in terms of performance, cost, complexity, and practicality compared to existing DIFT implementations.

    \caption{Representation of a Hardware Off-Core DIFT (inspired by Figure 1 of~\cite{KDK-09-dsn})}
    \label{fig:offcore_dift}
\end{figure}

Wahab et al.~\cite{WCAHBLG-18-reconfig,WCAHLG-17-fpl} developed a DIFT using the ARM CoreSight debug component to extract a trace.
However, the debug component could only extract limited information about the application executing on the core. Therefore, some instrumentations have been required to recover the complete program trace. The information obtained from the trace is then sent to a dedicated DIFT coprocessor, which analyses the instruction trace and propagates tags according to a security policy. In terms of performance and area footprint, \cite{WCAHLG-17-fpl} gives around 5\% communication overhead and an area overhead of 0.47\% and a power consumption increased by 16\%; while~\cite{WCAHBLG-18-reconfig} gives a communication overhead of 335\%, an area increased by 0.95\% and a power consumption increased by 16.2\%. These results can not be compared to the initial design, as they use a coprocessor without the ARM core results.

\paragraph{Off-Loading DIFT} use a dedicated core of a multicore CPU~\cite{CKSFGMRRRV-08-sigarch,VHYR-08-cca,RGMRCKR-08-spaa}. Figure~\ref{fig:offloading_dift} represents how Off-Loading DIFT works with a core running the application and another, in parallel, run the DIFT analysis on the application trace. The application core is modified to create a trace and compress it. The trace includes executed instructions and packs main information such as PC address, register operands. This trace is then sent to the DIFT core via the L2 cache. Finally, the security core will decompress the trace and realizes tag computation in order to check whether an illegal information flow has been done. The notion of illegal information flow is specified thanks to a DIFT security policy.
The main advantage is that hardware does not need to know DIFT tags or policies and does not need a coprocessor with the management of the synchronisation between the two processors.  But the main drawback is that it requires a multicore CPU but reduces the number of core available and doubles the energy consumption due to the application trace analysis. In an embedded system where consumption is a critical factor, this solution is difficult to consider.

    \caption{Representation of a Hardware Off-Loading DIFT (inspired by Figure 1 of~\cite{KDK-09-dsn})}
    \label{fig:offloading_dift}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{In-Core DIFT} rely on a deeply modified processor pipeline which need to integrate tag computations inside the main core in parallel of data computations. This approach is highly invasive, but does not require any additional cores or coprocessors to operate and introduces no overhead for intercore synchronisation. Overall, its performance impact in terms of clock cycles over native execution is minimal. On the other hand, the integrated approach requires significant modifications to the processor core. All pipeline stages must be modified to add tags, a dedicated register file and first level of caches must be added to store tags in parallel with the regular blocks into the processor core. Figure~\ref{fig:incore_dift} shows the architecture of an In-Core hardware DIFT. When the processor fetches an instruction, its associated tag is sent in parallel. In the decode stage, the instruction is decoded while the security decode module decode the security policy to determine how the tag should be propagated and checked. When the instruction is executed, the tag is sent to a tag ALU to be checked. Then, if the tag is conforming to the security policy, the tag and the ALU output will be saved into the Data-Cache to be used again or stored in memory. Otherwise, if the tag is not conforming, the DIFT mechanism detects the security violation and can raise an exception, stop the application, depending on what is configured.

    \label{fig:incore_dift}
\end{figure}

Suh et al.~\cite{SLD-04-sigplan} proposed an approach in which the OS identifies a set of input channels as spurious, and the processor tracks all information flows from these inputs. Thanks to this tracking, the processor can detect various attacks such as attack targetting instructions or jump addresses. If the security policy detects something malicious in hardware, the OS will process the exception. They use a 1-bit tag, which means only two ways of representing security levels. They present two security policies that track differing sets of dependencies. Implementing the first policy incurs, on average, a memory overhead of 0.26\% and a performance decrease of 0.02\%. The second policy incurs, on average, a memory overhead of 4.48\% and a performance decrease of 0.8\%, and requires binary annotation unlike the first policy.

Dalton et al.\cite{DKK-07-sigarch} presented a DIFT architecture, Raksha, to support a flexible security configuration at runtime. They extended all storage locations including registers, caches and main memory with tags, they modified the ISA instruction to propagate and check tags. In this solution, they use 4-bits tags for each word. These tags represent the security policy and not the data state (e.g. trusted or untrusted). The authors provided two global sets of configuration registers, i.e., Tag Propagation Registers (TPR) and Tag Check Registers (TCR), to configure the security policy at runtime. There is one pair of TPR/TCR for each of the four security policies. The configuration register could be configured only in trusted mode. Moreover, the tag propagation and check could only be disabled in trusted mode. However, the security policy is difficult to update when the architecture is deployed.
The Raksha prototype is based on the Leon SPARC V8 processor, a 32-bit open-source synthesizable core, and they mapped the design onto an FPGA board.

Palmiero et al.~\cite{PDGLC-18-hpec} implemented a DIFT framework, D-RI5CY, on a RISC-V processor and synthesized it on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board with a focus on IoT applications. The proposed design tags every word in data memory with a 4-bits tag and every general register with a 1-bit tag. Similarly to~\cite{DKK-07-sigarch}, Palmiero et al.~\cite{PDGLC-18-hpec} also adopted global configuration registers to customise the rule of tag propagation and checking. Each type of instruction has its own rule and can be modified separately. This method provides a more fine-grain tracking than Raksha but lacks flexibility for security policy reconfiguration for different program contexts.

\subsection{How hardware DIFT work}
DIFT is a technique used in computer security to monitor the flow of information through a system. It aims to prevent security breaches such as data leaks, unauthorised data manipulation, and execution of untrusted code. In DIFT, each data is associated with a tag that indicates its security level.
For example, a tag might indicate whether data is 'trusted' or 'untrusted'. When data is input into the system, it is initially tagged based on its source.

As data moves through the system, these tags are tracked to ensure compliance with security policies and to ensure that sensitive information does not get exposed or manipulated improperly. For instance, if an operation involves both trusted and untrusted data, the result might be tagged as untrusted to ensure security.

An example of such security policy can be represented in Table~\ref{table:security_policies}. In this example, if the data comes from the network or if it's manipulated by a user, in the case of a \verb|scanf()| function in C language for example, the data cannot be trusted, while if the data comes from a secure channel or is manipulated by the system itself, the data can be trusted.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Security policies for different data inputs}
    \label{table:security_policies}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}rcc@{}}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Data Input} & \textbf{Security Policy} & \textbf{Tag}     \\ \midrule
        User Input          & User-provided            & Untrusted        \\ \hline
        Network             & External source          & Untrusted        \\ \hline
        Internal            & System-provided          & Trusted          \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:dift_init} illustrates the three main steps of how DIFT works. Firstly, three data, $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$, with their associated tags in three different colours, are initialised on the left side of the figure.

In the second step, when the data is fetched by the core for computation, the associated tags are propagated inside the core and confronted with the propagation policy depending on the operations performed on the data.

Finally, in the last step, on the right side of the figure, there are two data outputs derived from the three initial data. Data $C_4$ results from the combination of data $C_2$ and $C_3$, while data $C_5$ is derived from data $C_1$. Since data $C_1$ has not been modified, its tag remains the same. However, the tag associated with $C_4$ is a mix of tags from $C_2$ and $C_3$. Depending on the security policy, if $C_2$ was trusted and $C_3$ was not, the output tag will be \textit{untrusted}. Consequently, when the tags go through the final step of DIFT, they will be checked, and an exception may be raised or the application may be stopped due to the mixing of \textit{trusted} and \textit{untrusted} values.

\section{Physical Attacks}
\label{section:physicalAttacks}

This section presents an overview of the state of the art on physical attacks. We present the different types of physical attacks and their methods to recover secret information. Firstly, we begin with Side-Channel Attacks, how to use information leakage to recover useful information and how to analyse them.
Secondly, we introduce Fault Injection Attacks. We define the different possibilities of injection and how to achieve them.

Physical attacks are separated into two main categories: passive attacks and active attacks. Passive attacks are also called Side-Channel Attacks (SCA), and active attacks are often called Fault Injection Attacks (FIA). Figure~\ref{fig:arbo_fia} shows a representation of a taxonomy to classify the different method of physical attacks. Each type of attacks will be explained in this following subsections.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \caption{Taxonomy of the different methods of physical attacks (inspired by~\cite{CKNDCTD-21-compsec})}
    \label{fig:arbo_fia}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Side-Channel Attacks}
Side-Channel Attacks exploit information leakages on the circuit behaviour such as power consumption, electromagnetic radiation or the execution time of an application.
This type of attack does not call into question the theoretical integrity of the implementation, but aims to recover information by devious means. During data processing, the alternation between different states requires time and minimal energy dissipation, the variations of which can be analysed by the attacker.
This information allows the attacker to access secret data such as a password, or cryptographic key. The origin of these attacks date back to the \mbox{TEMPEST} program from NSA~\cite{F-72-nsa}. They described the vulnerabilities of a cryptographic implementation from their electromagnetic emissions, depending on the input and data.

Figure~\ref{fig:sca} represents the different methods of SCA on a microprocessor. We will go into detail of these different methods in the following text. The main idea is to have an application running on the processor and an attacker will use one method to trace the application multiple times to recover secret information (e.g. cryptographic key, password, private data, etc.).

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Power analysis} exploits time differences in target power consumption during sensitive executions. Modern systems contain billions of transistors (up to 146 billions transistors for an AMD CPU Instinct MI300A\footnote{\url{https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi300a.html}} or up to 208 billions transistors for a Nvidia GPU GB200 Grace Blackwell\footnote{\url{https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing}}). These transistors act as voltage switches and as they are continually switched on/off during execution, they cause voltage variations that can be observed and measured using equipments and devices (oscilloscope, voltmeter, etc.). These results data are analysed and from a certain number of data, an attacker can deduce secrets.
Kocher et al.~\cite{KJJ-98-crypto,KJJR-11-jce} introduced this method of SCA to recover cryptographic key from the analysis of power consumption. They introduced the Simple Power Analysis method (SPA) and Differential Power Analysis (DPA)~\cite{GP-99-ches}. While SPA attacks mainly use visual inspection to identify relevant power variations, DPA attacks use statistical analysis and error correction techniques to extract information correlated to secret keys.
Lipp et al.~\cite{LKOSECG-21-sp} present an attack, PLATYPUS, a software-based power side-channel attack on Intel server, desktop, and laptop CPU. They exploit unprivileged access to the Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interface. By observing variations in power consumption, they achieve to monitor the control flow of applications and also infer data and extract cryptographic keys.

\paragraph{Execution time analysis} also known as timing attacks and first introduced by Kocher~\cite{K-96-crypto}, takes advantage of the fact that some sensitive computational operations vary in time depending on their secret inputs. An attacker can learn information about these inputs by measuring the running time of the operation. Inherently, these attacks require the attacker to obtain responses from the target to measure its runtime. The works of Kocher~\cite{K-96-crypto}, Brumley and Boneh~\cite{DD-05-compnet} demonstrate attacks on many popular cryptosystems, including DSS, RSA, and OpenSSL.

\paragraph{Electromagnetic analysis} exploits electromagnetic (EM) emissions signatures produced when conducting logic operations. Thus, EM emissions reflect the operations of the system. In 2001, Quisquater and Samyde~\cite{QS-01-scps} extended SCA with EM analysis.
EM SCA methods can be divided into Simple EM Attack (SEMA) and Differential EM Attack (DEMA) similarly to power attacks~\cite{ANM-19-di}. By observing different signal patterns of collected traces, SEMA can directly interpret cryptographic operations. DEMA extracts secret keys by comparing collected EM traces to hypothesised values and looking for peaks indicative of an accurate prediction~\cite{HGTVJ-22-dt}.
The attacker collects EM radiation using an EM probe. The probe is placed near the electronic equipment. At this stage, the quality of the collected EM traces, and thus the effectiveness of EM SCA, is strongly affected by several measurement parameters such as EM probe, noise, trigger, sampling rate and frequency band. Recent work has shown that different EM probe characteristics (e.g. diameter, orientation) and spatial location significantly affect EM traces~\cite{HMHSS-12-tcrypo,KSTO-17-iccad, WDL-16-ntms}.

\paragraph{Temperature analysis} exploit the temperature values induced by the activity of the system. This attack is linked to electromagnetic and power analysis, as they use traces from the system's execution. Aljuffri et al.~\cite{AZRHT-21-tvlsi} presented a study on thermal analysis where three different power-based SCAs were modified for thermal attacks and applied to a naive RSA implementation. Their experiments were able to retrieve the secret key with an accuracy of 100\%. Another experiment attacked a protected implementation of RSA and completed the extraction of the key with only five traces. Hutter et al.~\cite{HS-14-cardis} present results of data leakages of CMOS devices from temperature SCA. They study the leakage of processed data by measuring the dissipated heat of the devices.

\paragraph{Acoustic analysis} takes advantage of the analysis of the sound emitted by the systems. This technology has been around for a long time and is used in many fields, such as sonar. The "golden ear" in a submarine listens to the sounds of the sea and is able to detect and distinguish a submarine, a warship, or a merchant vessel by the sound of its turbine alone. It is also able to determine its direction and nationality.

Computers emit high-pitched sounds when they are running. This is due to vibrations in some of their electronic components. These sounds are more than just a nuisance. They can convey information about the software running on the computer. In particular, they can reveal sensitive information about security-related calculations. People have shown that it is possible to recover RSA keys from their sound.
Backes et al.~\cite{BDGPS-10-usenix} present an attack that retrieves what a dot-matrix printer is printing from a recording of the sound it makes. Their experiments show that they can recover up to 72\% of the words printed, and up to 95\% if they know the context of the text. For this experiment, they used a dictionary-based approach to printed English words.
Genkin et al.~\cite{GST-17-crypto} demonstrated that RSA key extraction using acoustic cryptanalysis was feasible against a Lenovo laptop from a smartphone nearby. The authors targeted GnuPG's RSA implementation using a laboratory microphone setup and a Samsung Note II, and showed that a 4096-bit key could be recovered within an hour using audible and ultrasonic sound emanations. Harrison et al.~\cite{HTM-23-eurospw} present an implementation of a deep-learning model to classify laptop keystrokes using a microphone. They use the trained model to recognise the keystrokes, and they achieve an accuracy of 95\%. They trained their model from a Zoom conference and this time they achieve an accuracy of 93\%. Their results have shown that it is possible to recover password or other secret information of a victim from its keystrokes even without a physical presence.

\subsection{Fault Injection Attacks}
As early as the 1970s, with advances in the space industry, anomalies in the operation of electronic circuits were observed and possibly linked to cosmic radiation outside the Earth's atmosphere~\cite{BSH-75-tns,Z-96-ibm,ZL-79-science}. These disturbances were initially found to affect the performance of electronic systems in space environments, where high-energy particles could disrupt the normal functioning of circuits. However, as transistors became smaller and required less energy to operate, similar phenomena were observed in terrestrial environments and aircraft systems. These transient disturbances, commonly referred to as "\textit{soft errors}", are now recognised as a critical issue in both space and ground electronics, affecting everything from memory chips to complex processors.

However, in addition to these induces cosmic faults, wanted faults exist and are known as Fault Injection Attacks (FIA). FIA involves deliberately introducing a fault into the system to observe its behaviour and identify potential vulnerabilities. If the error caused by the fault does not propagate and execution of the application completes normally, the fault is ineffective. On the other hand, if the fault affects the execution of the application, causing it to fail or behave differently than expected, then the fault is effective. These faults can impact the performance, functionality, and reliability of the circuit. These attacks can induce errors in internal electronic components, which can be utilised to recover cryptographic keys and other secret data.
These attacks have been vastly studied since the first introduction of these attacks by Boneh et al. in 1997~\cite{BDL-97-eurocrypt,BDL-01-crypto}. Multiple studies or surveys~\cite{ZAV-06-jarab, BCNTW-06-procieee, CKNDCTD-21-compsec, PBR-15-dtis, YSW-18-hss, BH-22-access} present the different sources of FIA.
Figure~\ref{fig:fia} presents a summary of the different methods of FIA, the figure does not represent all possible methods. Each of these attacks requires equipment which is more or less expensive and easy to acquire, ranging from a few hundred euros (clock glitches, voltage glitches) to several hundred thousand (Laser, X-Ray, Focused Ion Beam).

As shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:arbo_fia}, these attacks are categorised as transient or permanent, and invasive or non-invasive.
The effect of a transient fault lasts for a limited period of time. These faults rarely do any lasting damage to the component affected, although they can induce an erroneous state in the system. Their aim is to temporarily disrupt the program control flow or corrupt the results of an instruction to gain unauthorised access to sensitive code and data.
By opposition, permanent faults or destructive faults, created by purposely inflicted defects to the chipâ€™s structure, have a permanent effect. Once inflicted, such destructions will affect the chipâ€™s behaviour permanently and persist irrespective of device restarts and resets.

Invasive attacks involve major alteration to the Device Under Test (DUT), such as decapping the System-on-Chip (SoC) to expose its internals and remove any protective layers. These processes risk irreparable damage or destruction of the target under evaluation, potentially leading to permanent data loss.

Non-invasive attacks require no tampering of the DUT. They are able to mask their presence as they have no effect on the system other than the faults they inject.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Invasive attacks}
Invasive attacks need to decapsulate the chip or the Integrated Circuit (IC).
Decapsulating a die or integrated circuit (IC) is a process used to expose the internal components of an IC, typically for failure analysis or reverse engineering. The goal is to carefully remove the protective encapsulation, which shields the silicon die and is typically made of epoxy or ceramic, without causing damage to the internal structures. There are several methods to achieve this, each suited to different packaging materials and levels of precision, ranging from chemical processes to advanced techniques like laser ablation and plasma etching.

The most common method is chemical decapsulation, which involves etching away the epoxy with concentrated acids such as nitric or sulphuric acid. This process requires safety precautions such as protective clothing and neutralisation of the acids after removal of the encapsulation. It is an effective but dangerous process and require careful control to avoid damaging the die, as over-etching can cause irreversible harm.

Another method is laser decapsulation, which uses a precision laser to remove the encapsulation material layer by layer. This technique is highly accurate and reduces the risk of damage to the die, but it is expensive and requires specialised equipment. Mechanical decapsulation involves physically grinding or cutting away the encapsulation, but has a high risk of damaging the die, especially when approaching the final layers.

Plasma etching is a more advanced technique that uses ionised gases to gradually etch away the encapsulation material. It offers high precision but is slower than other methods and is typically used in research or industrial environments. Whichever method is used, safety precautions are essential, especially when dealing with hazardous chemicals and sensitive materials.

Figure~\ref{fig:decapsulating_die} shows three different steps to decapsulate a circuit. To be noted, this processor is the AMD Zen2 EPYC 7702 server processor which is not for embedded systems.

\paragraph{Camera flash/light source} is a type of optical attack. The attacker needs to decapsulate the chip, and the strong radiation emitted by the flash directed at the silicon surface can cause the blanking of memory cells where constant values are stored for algorithms execution (e.g., the AES S-Boxes). These attacks are inexpensive, but, in the other hand, they are not very accurate. Skorobogatov et al.~\cite{SA-02-ches} used a flashgun for \$30 while being able to change any bit of an SRAM array.

Schmidt and Hutter~\cite{SH-07-austrochip} present practical attacks on implementations of RSA that use Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). These attacks have been performed into a cryptographic device through optical and EM injections. They use a laser diode  as a light source, the diode emitts a light  beam of \SI{100}{\milli\watt} with a wavelength of \SI{785}{\nano\metre}. The light from the diode is guided thanks to a fibre-optic of 1~mm in diameter.

Guillen et al.~\cite{GGD-17-cosade} present a low-cost fault injection setup, around couple hundred euros, which is capable of producing localized faults in modern 8-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. This setup does not require handling dangerous substances or wearing protection equipment. The fault produced by this setup are able to successfully attack real-world cryptographic implementations, such as the NSAâ€™s Speck lightweight block cipher~\cite{RDJSBL-13-nsa}.

\paragraph{Laser beam} is another type of optical attacks.
The injected fault is similar to the one used with a camera flash, with the exception of which is a lot more precise and is capable of always inducing faults.
The main downside of this method is that it requires a high expertise.
Dutertre et al.~\cite{DBCDFFGHLMDPR-18-fdtc} explain the theory behind this technique at the lowest level.

Figure~\ref{fig:ls2} shows an example of a laser fault injection station made by Riscure.
It contains powerful red and NIR diode lasers (resp.\SI{14}{\watt}, and \SI{20}{\watt}). The red laser is designed for frontside testing of smart card chips and in combination with the optics it produces a spot size of 6 * \SI{1.4}{\micro\metre} on the chip surface. The near-infrared laser is designed for backside testing of smart card chips. This powerful diode laser penetrates the chip substrate to reach the transistors.
This station automates the surface scanning process, offers precise control of laser power, and injects pulses with a small spot size. It has a precise and fast response thanks to a trigger and the ability to perform multi-glitching.

Using a laser beam, a single bit~\cite{CMDMRD-19-host} in a memory can be set (from logical 0 to logical 1) or reset (from logical 1 to logical 0) by attacking either front side or the back side of the chip.
Today, the capabilities of laser injection mechanisms make it possible to carry out attacks with multiple faults.
Colombier et al.~\cite{CGVCBLC-22-cardis} use a four-spot laser bench to inject up to 4 non-contiguous bits in a single cycle, or multiple non-contiguous bits over multiple cycles. This fault injection mechanism therefore makes it possible to construct much more complex attacks, potentially capable of bypassing many countermeasures.

Breier et al.~\cite{JHJBC-17-hss} studied the fault mechanism of circuit logic elements in FPGA environment, and performed a practical laser fault injection into a single bit CED-protected block cipher in Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA.
Figure~\ref{fig:lfi_setup} shows their setup to inject fault into a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA.
The chip is preprocessed by a mechanical solution in order to reduce the substrate thickness, to approximatively \SI{100}{\micro\metre}. Thinner substrate leads to easier laser penetration, at the risk of destroying logic resources or routing channels on the chip.
The laser used is a \SI{20}{\watt} diode pulse laser with 5 times magnification lens, which reduce the effective maximum power to \SI{10}{\watt}. The wavelength is \SI{1064}{\nano\metre} and the spot size of the laser beam is approximatively \SI{840}{\micro\metre}$^2$.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Focused ion beam} is the most accurate and powerful fault injection technique used. Focused ion beam (FIB) enables an attacker to arbitrarily modify the structure of a circuit, reconstruct missing buses, cut existing wires and rebuild them.

FIB can operate at a precision of \SI{2.5}{\nano\metre}, which is the size of a transistors in actual IC. FIB workstations require very expensive consumables and a strong technical background to fully exploit their capabilities. The only limit to the FIB technology is the diameter of the atoms whose ions are used as a scalpel. Currently, the most common choice is Gallium, which sets the lower bound to roughly \SI{0.135}{\nano\metre}.

\subsubsection{Non-invasive attacks}
Non-invasive attacks involve inducing errors in a system without physically tampering with the device. These attacks exploit external influences like electromagnetic interference, voltage glitches, or clock signal manipulation to cause faults during the device's operation. Unlike invasive methods, which require dismantling or altering the hardware, non-invasive techniques leave no physical traces, making them harder to detect. By injecting faults at precise moments, attackers can bypass security mechanisms, retrieve sensitive data, or alter the device's intended functionality.

\paragraph{X-Rays} is another approach to inject fault very precisely but this method is not invasive as X-Rays can go through the IC package without the need of decapsulating it. Another advantage is that X-Ray have a lot smaller wavelength, down to \SI{0.01}{\nano\meter}, than laser injection which are limited to the wavelength of their light source, down to \SI{1}{\micro\meter}.
The injected fault is semi-permanent, and to make it disappear, the attacker has to heat up the device. This differs from other techniques where the fault can disappear a few cycles after injection.
This technique can be compared as a non-invasive FIB techniques. X-ray provides many opportunities for attacking electronic circuits. Among them, we can note the possibility to cause permanent faults in cryptographic algorithms, deactivation of countermeasures, reprogramming of memories, etc.

Anceau et al.~\cite{ABCMRT-17-ches, BAMCST-23-dft} propose an approach for modifying the behaviour of a transistor in the memory of a circuit using focused X-ray beams. 
They use the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), in Grenoble, France.

Grandamne et al.~\cite{GBD-23-paine} show efficiency of X-Ray faults injection on flash and EEPROM memories for powered off devices. They also describe a fault model according to their experimental results and propose a solution to correct a part of the fault.
