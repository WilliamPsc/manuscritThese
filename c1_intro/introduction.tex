This work is segmented in seven chapters, the first being this introduction.

Chapter~\ref{chapter:soa}

Chapter~\ref{chapter:dift_assessment} presents the background of this work with the presentation of the RISC-V ISA, the architecture of the D-RI5CY core and the DIFT works. Then, the use cases used in this work are going to be presented. Finally, a vulnerability assessment will be done to show how these use case are vulnerable against FIA and where.

Chapter~\ref{chapter:fissa} introduces a new tool to automatise fault injection campaigns in simulation. This tool, FISSA, allows a designer to assess his design during the conception phase. This chapter will present how it works and how to use it, and compares it to others tool available in the literature.

Chapter~\ref{chapter:countermeasures} details the different implementation of countermeasures to protect the D-RI5CY core against FIA and evaluate these protections in terms of area, performance, and efficiency.

Chapter~\ref{chapter:exp_setup_results}

Chapter~\ref{chapter:conclusion}
